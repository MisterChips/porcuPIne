===========
Raspberry Pi based central heating/boiler controller. Python based.

Hardware: Thermostat (to be placed in usual central heating thermostat position) consisting of: RaspPi with attached, via GPIO, digital Dallas temperature sensor, and serial RF module. Future development: LCD display, 5 button menu navigation system.

RF Relay switching unit (placed near boiler (but not too near!!! More later)): Mains powered, RF/DualRelay unit. Used to control 2 circuits for Central Heating and Hot Water separately.

Future Development: Create more RF remote switching/sensor units for Home automation/sensing.
